<h3>Short description :</h3>
 <br />
 The project consists of 2 scenes (sunset and night time scenes)
 <br />
 The scene starts with a deserted boat being away pushed by the wind's and the ocean's force in addition to 3 fallen boxes off of it as the sun sets while the rain is falling non stop and a mad hurricane waiting to crush it.
 <br />
 The sunlight's intensity will start to fade away as the sun goes down after 15 seconds from the initial scene's launch.
 <br />
 Darkness covers the sky and the hurricane hits the lonely boat to toss it to the sharks while the lightning bolts covers the sky.
 <br />
 The boat drown in the ocean but after some time it floats back to surface to continue it's journey in the fog.
